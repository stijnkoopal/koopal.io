A supportive and enthusiastic team player that thinks highly of quality, but can be pragmatic if required. I tend to use the simplest solution best fit for the situation, keeping in mind the full architectural context of the application.\n\nThe thought of a fast, highly scalable and decoupled service architecture makes me happy, as does an elegant implementation. A very well-designed and maintainable frontend is key. I mostly enjoy working in a team, and building an awesome application together is very important to me.\n\nThe beautiful city of Utrecht is my home, and I tend to socialize there with friends a lot. I enjoy being outside, especially when exercising.\n\nInterested? Drop me a line!",

      "description": "Modelling how water flows on landscapes in order to predict floods and other environmental phenomena, has always been of major importance in hydrology and ecological sciences. Today, flow modelling on landscapes is performed in a computer-based environment using digital representations of real-world terrains. One of the most popular digital terrain representations are the so-called Triangulated Irregular Networks (TINs) which are piecewise linear surfaces that consist of triangles. A natural way to model water flow on a surface is to assume that, at any point on the surface, water follows the direction of steepest descent (DSD). However, even this simple flow model has been proven computationally infeasible when applied on TINs. On the other hand, there exist many methods that compute flow paths on TINs approximately, that is without following strictly the DSD on the surface. Such methods do not suffer from the computational problems of the exact flow model. However, flow structures that are produced using these methods may provide a poor approximation of the structures that would be generated by the exact flow model. In this thesis we present various approximate algorithms for computing an important type of flow structure on TINs, namely watersheds. We evaluate these algorithms both in terms of efficiency and approximation quality in comparison to the exact flow model. We consider two different categories of methods; the first category involves methods that use exact arithmetic, and they can introduce new vertices on the TIN with coordinates of possibly large bit-size. The methods of the second category can only perform computations that use floating-point numbers. Among other results, we show that a widely used method provides the least quality of approximation in practice. We introduce methods that present a very good quality of approximation. Furthermore, we show that some methods do well on mountainous terrain whereas others do better on nearly flat terrains."
